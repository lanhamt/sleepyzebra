# Sleepy Zebra

## About
Final project for cs244b Autumn 2017

## Background 
Wireless sensor networks have extraordinary resource constraints that demand low power consumption in order to extend longevity. Designing distributed algorithms to work on low-power, resource-constrained devices is a challenging problem and requires a different approach than a typical distributed environment. We examine one such algorithm, Trickle, in depth, experimentally measuring its behavior on real-world hardware and under simulated conditions. We also extend the algorithm to add an optimization that allows nodes to turn off their radios for a set period of time to conserve energy.

## Materials
This repo contains the simulator and hardware testbed setup and results.
