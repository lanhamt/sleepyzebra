The files `trickle.c` and `sleepy_trickle.c` implement the Trickle algorithm
on the TockOS platform. Place these files in the `tock/userland/examples/[sleepy_]trickle/`
directories, and build with the libtock library. Note that these files will not
compile by themselves, and require the libraries that come with Tock in order
to run.
